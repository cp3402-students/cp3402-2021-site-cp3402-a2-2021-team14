The website has been designed to be minimalistic and clean. All content within the pages has been centered so as to draw the main focus into the column structure. With memberships being one of our main call-to-actions this menu selection has been highlighted on every page so as to be the first thing the user will see when interacting with the website. The majority of the pages containing large amounts of text have been organized into a more natural feeling layout.
The theme contains a main theme, which is responsible for the style and functionality of the main interface. The code is in the style.css file and function.php file in the root directory. The style.css file is divided into 15 sections, some of which contain subitems that are responsible for styling different content on the main screen. The general table of contents is stated in the comments at the beginning of the code, and there are comments at the beginning of every section of the code, allowing developers to select the sections they want to change based on the comments.
The header and footer function design of all the pages in the theme are located separately in the header.php and footer.php files in the root directory.
