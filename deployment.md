Hello world
At the beginning, our group collected information about maternal and child products and prepared a website related to maternal and child products. As we all know, mother and baby market is a big market with many business opportunities. During the preparation, I found a lot of materials about mother and baby, analyzed them on Trello, and collected and sorted out these information. Through GitHub, each member can intuitively understand each step and put forward their own opinions. Upload what you find and give others a few objections. Finally, after finishing, I made A2 HTML and made a schedule, orderly development, displaying all parts of the web page. The special features are also marked one by one, and each part has corresponding points that need to be improved, and everyone also makes suggestions. Finally make a complete website.
